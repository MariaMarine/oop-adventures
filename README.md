## Project Description:
A text based RPG adventure game

## Project Purpose:
To experience a very randomized but yet balanced gameplay in our text-based UI.

## Refactoring
We did quite a bit of that in the last week. The result is a completely inversify-ed project. Before that, there were 
many dependencies that were passed arround in method calls. Code is now a lot more readable, although addmitedly far from perfect.
